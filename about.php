	<p>Regex Quest is a game that teaches regular expressions by asking players to solve problems using only the wonderful tool that is Regular Expressions.  </p>
	<p>Some questions are very straight forward, but some require thought.  Additionally, some questions are multi-part, so you'll need to translate the text once, then use another expression to translate it once again.</p>
	<p>Three different modes - easy, medium, insane - are here to train users and give a reasonable judge what level master you are!</p>
